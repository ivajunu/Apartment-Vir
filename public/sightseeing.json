      "description": "The Zadar region is actually one of Croatia's 21 Counties. It has a truly amazing geographical position, located in the centre of the East Adriatic and surrounded by stunning nature of great variety. This is the place where natural and cultural heritage coexists in perfect harmony and where lovely coastal resorts provide excellent conditions for both active vacation and relaxed family holiday. As the centre of the region and the former capital of Dalmatia, the 3000-year old city of Zadar is the starting point of many excited visitors. It is a proud city of rich and interesting tradition and amazing cultural heritage, however it is by no means only of that reputation, as little coastal towns like Biograd and Nin clearly show how the whole area was tremendously important for Croatian Kings, as well as for the great empires of the Romans, Venetians, Turks, Hungarians and Austrians respectively. The long and indented coast of surreal beauty and splendid peaks of the imposing mountains will make you forget all your worries, leaving you in awe once you realize how many diverse natural wonders can be found around you.National parks, nature parks, islands, reserves, woods, fields, groves, bays, coves and beaches are all integral part of that great nature story that captures the heart and intrigues the mind, so be sure to come and see for yourself what inspires thousands and thousands of visitors to always come back in search for new experiences in some friendly and familiar setting of the Zadar region!
